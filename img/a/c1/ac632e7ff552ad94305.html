<h4>Narrative</h4>
<p>In the original file &quot;ALLAN Family Tree.rtf&quot;, on the CD &quot;ALLAN FAMILY HISTORY&quot;, supplied by Elizabeth Caldicott (Margaret), Margaret LINDSAY is stated as born in Bacchus Marsh.  This must be incorrect, as her marriage registry entry, with father Robert Lindsay and mother Jennett Inglis, states she was born in King Horn, Scotland.  The marriage registry does however state that she resided in Bacchusmarsh at the time of marriage.</p><p>This file also states that Robert LINDSAY was born in Bacchus Marsh.  This does not match other family trees, such as the &quot;Cotter, Ruths, Kealys, Clancys, Lyalls, etc 5th Dec 04&quot; family tree, which has him born in possibly Kinghorn, Fifeshire, Scotland (as too Janet Inglis).</p><p>This file also states that Archibald (Alexander)Parkes ALLAN was born in Clyde, Scotland.  This must also be incorrect, as the same marriage registry states he was born in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><p></p><p>This file also has (unknown) as the wife for Archibald (Alexander) Parkes ALLAN's first marriage.  I am assuming this is Ann Steven, because the children Alexander, Annie and possibly Katy (see below) match this marriage.</p><p>This file also states that Katy was a daughter of Archibald (Alexander) Parkes ALLAN.  I am assuming Katy is short for Catherine (Bell Allan).</p><p>This file also states that Lena PRESS was born (1.5.1907) or 14.12.1880.  These dates do not match her birth registry which states she was born in 1878.</note></p>
