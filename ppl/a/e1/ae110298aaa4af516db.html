<p>Notes for EDWARD AUGUSTUS PETHERICK:</p><p>Notes from Manuscript Collection National Library of Australia, Canberra</p><p>Petherick Collection MS 760/1</p><p>Matters concerning the PRESS FAMILY in Burnham, Somerset Eng.</p><p>compiled from letters written by Edward Augustus PETHERICK from</p><p>LONDON to his family in MELBOURNE during the period 1870 - 1877.</p><p>Compiled by Pirrie K (Petherick) Shiel Jan 1994</p><p>All the letters were addressed to his father Peter John Petherick unless</p><p>otherwise stated. Compiler's comments eg [Press]</p><p>E A Petherick had worked for the book seller George Robertson in</p><p>Melbourne for 8 years, when at the age of 23 year, he was sent to England</p><p>to manage the London office.</p><p>MS 760/1/50 June 1870</p><p>EAP left from Hobson's Bay, Victoria aboard the &quot;GREAT BRITIAN&quot; on</p><p>15th June 1870. Uncle [Alfred Press ] came with EAP's father Peter John</p><p>Petherick and EAP's younger brothers Ernest and Edgar to say good-bye.</p><p>MS760/1/57 Sept 1870</p><p>EAP went to Burnham, it cost 2 pound, visited PJP's mother's house [Mary</p><p>Phillips Petherick] in Salmon Parade, near archway at Searle's.</p><p>Sarah Ann, Bessie and Mariane Press went with him to Bridgewater.</p><p>MS760/1/60 Nov 1870</p><p>Henry Press' ship was wrecked but all hands saved.</p><p>MS 760/1/68 Jan 1871</p><p>Edwin and Jim [Press] have had a falling out. They have bought a boat</p><p>together. Jim is enterprising. Edwin won't go out to look [for ships]. Jim goes</p><p>to sea for a week looking for ships coming in. Jim makes up accounts</p><p>regularly but Edwin doesn't. They take it in turns to pay the man they</p><p>employ but Edwin is lax in keeping accounts. They are doing well but have</p><p>difficulties over who is boss. Jim sacked the deckhand, Edwin said he could</p><p>stay. Edwin was annoyed that Jim gave two guineas for repairing the</p><p>Chapel. Jim wants to give up his share of the boat and is negotiating to sell</p><p>off the &quot;Dorset and Devon&quot; and the adjoining house. He is thinking of going</p><p>alone to Australia and to send for the others later. Jim and Sarah may go but</p><p>SarahAnn will go into the shop with Richard. [?]</p><p>Jim's son Tom is a good looking young fellow and it's a pity to see him and</p><p>William shut up in Burnham and Wedmore.</p><p>Henry has as much as he can do to look after and attend upon his wife.</p><p>[Louise] He's very kind and 'soft'. He talks of Australia only his wife has fits</p><p>so often. She had two or three severe attacks while EAP was in Burnham but</p><p>should be better now for a month. The young Henry is very rough in his</p><p>manner and courser in tone of voice than any of the family.</p><p>Sarah Ann is very nice, kind and homely, too good.</p><p>Edwin's two girls Mariane [Mary Ann] and Bessie [Elizabeth] are nice too.</p><p>Mariane is most lady like, homely, thoughtful and diligent. EAP's favourite</p><p>not excepting Charlotte. He feels at home with them.</p><p>Aunt Sarah [Jim's wife] is sweet, speaks as if she is out of breath. Aunt Ann</p><p>13 24 Oct 2006</p><p>[Edwin's wife] is motherly, has to &quot;talk to the boys when necessary&quot;. [scolds]</p><p>&quot;Uncle Nicholas&quot; is getting rich with lots of houses.</p><p>MS 760/1/74</p><p>Copy of James Press Senior's will sent. [To PJP?]</p><p>MS 760/1/83 May 1871</p><p>[EAP refers to] Aunt Annie and Uncle Alfred [Press] in Melbourne.</p><p>MS 760/1/94 Aug/Sept 1871</p><p>EAP in Burnham again and discribes the view from Aunt Ann's window.</p><p>He writes in her accent, Bessie and Mariane are reading and he is writing.</p><p>MS 760/1/129 Sept 1872</p><p>Uncle Jim [Press] told how Harry lost the Cardiff steamer- not his fault but</p><p>he was the captain. The engine-driver was drunk, she turned on her side and</p><p>broke into pieces. Henry nearly drowned. 'Another misfortune for young</p><p>Henry!' Uncle Edwin is now piloting the boats across. Don't know what</p><p>Henry does.</p><p>Harry [Captain Henry] lost the &quot;FLORA&quot; [is Flora the Cardiff ateamer?]</p><p>Uncle James' broken rib has mended.</p><p>Polly (Mariane) has gone to Bridgewater, Aunt Lousie [Uncle Henry wife]</p><p>has introduced her to the large drapery warehouse there. A L is a good</p><p>business woman in spite of her attacks. [?]</p><p>MS 760/1/131</p><p>To Mother</p><p>EAP in Burnham and Bridgewater again visited Aunt Eliza Press [?] and</p><p>Aunt Nicholas with Tom. Her son was a grocer, now a carpenter. EAP</p><p>called at 2 Julia Terrace and talked with Mrs Walter Board upstairs in the</p><p>drawing room over looking the sea.</p><p>MS 760/1/136</p><p>Uncle Edwin away on the Cardiff steamer. Uncle Jim obliged to stay home</p><p>idle as there is no second pilot boat. No-one will work for jim as it is not</p><p>perminent because the boat is shared with Edwin.</p><p>Uncle Jim Aunt Sarah, Tom and Sarah to have a bootshop.</p><p>Uncle Henry still works as a pilot and must go out at least once or twice a</p><p>year to keep his certificate.</p><p>The Press family has started a Good Temple of total abstainers and they</p><p>want to enforce it on others. The Lodge is called &quot;Resque of Burnham&quot;- the</p><p>edge of the bottomless pit.</p><p>EAP jokes about it [not suprising since his father owns a hotel in</p><p>Melbourne] and refers to</p><p>the PRESS GANG</p><p>Henry Press -president</p><p>Tom Press -secretary</p><p>W J Press -worthy right-hand supporter [g.g.grandfather to Kate's husband]</p><p>Bessie Press -worthy left-hand supporter</p><p>Charlotte Press -something else</p><p>Mary Ann press - removed to Bridgewater</p><p>Sarah Ann won't have anything to do with it.</p><p>&quot;But the Press' aren't all Burnham, happily so, and Aunt Ann do have her half</p><p>pint.&quot;</p><p>14 24 Oct 2006</p><p>Oct 1872</p><p>Tom Press has come to London and gained employment at a grocer house as</p><p>an assistant at Kingsland London Nth at 20 pound per anum with board and</p><p>lodging. Its a first class place with no drudgery, storemen grind the coffee</p><p>and break the sugar.</p><p>MS 760/1/149 Dec 1872</p><p>Christmas in London with Tom. He shared my bed. [!!!] A turkey was sent</p><p>to the office [EAP'S] by William Mitchel, steel pen manufacturers of</p><p>Birmingham.</p><p>April 1873</p><p>Visited the Crystal Palace with Tom. [Press]</p><p>MS 760/1/164 Sept 1873</p><p>EAP holidayed at Burnham and went to Watchet for the first time to see St</p><p>Andrews, the castle and park, the model farm of Sir Alex Hood at eve and by</p><p>night to Williton. The Old Cleeve Abbey now rotting as a piggery then</p><p>around the seashore by the Blue Anchor. John and Thomas Press entertained</p><p>me during the Watchet trip. The air was clear between showers and I could</p><p>see the Welch coast. Also I could see Burnham from Minehead about 23</p><p>miles and was able to distinguish Uncle Edwin's house on Royal Parade. In</p><p>the evening the reflection on his windows was as brillant as the nearby light</p><p>house on 'The Holmes.'</p><p>Mrs Kingsbury ( nee Slocombe of Watchet) was with Charlotte who was</p><p>nursing a tiny twin several months old. The baby was even smaller than at</p><p>birth according to Aunt Sarah and died within afew days [Aug 1873]</p><p>He put up [stayed] with Aunt Lou's with Uncle Henry as valet. Henry took</p><p>EAP out in the boat as did Uncle Edwin and Jim in the 'Petrel'.</p><p>While at Watchet he saw Mrs Woodland and she talked of the twin born</p><p>girls. [ Were these Charlotte's ?]</p><p>Aunt Nancy's husband, who ever he maybe was in Thomas Press' shop in</p><p>Watchet.</p><p>Mariane was home Sunday to attend the Temple tea-meeting.</p><p>Henry has built the Templer Hotel at Burnham. Uncle Edwin has taken the</p><p>pledge and Uncle Henry is the only brother &quot;untied&quot;. He doesn't drink but</p><p>won't sign the pledge. Aunty Ann still has her 'two penneth'.</p><p>Bessie is going out [?] as soon as possible and Aunt Ann and Uncle Edwin</p><p>will be left alone with only servants.</p><p>Mr Wiggins [?] is well and keeps a shop to eke out his existance, in our old</p><p>shop. [PJPetherick's shop in Burnham]</p><p>EAP called on old Mrs Press [formerly Lovern ?] She intends going to</p><p>Australia in the near future. Uncle Henry spoke to her the other day, the only</p><p>time since grandfather died [James Press?] She is not on visiting terms with</p><p>either Aunt Sarah or Aunt Ann now that neither one ask her to have a beer.</p><p>Uncle Edwin and Jim's old house is in a disgraceful state having not been</p><p>done up for years, the walls are black.</p><p>MS 760/1/171</p><p>EAP send peacock feathers from Uncle Jim's peacocks, home to the girls.</p><p>MS 760/1/173 Oct 1873</p><p>Old Mrs Press is leaving on 24th Oct aboard the &quot;Great Britian&quot;.</p><p>EAP went to Manchester for five hours and spent time with Ernest Press</p><p>then returned to Liverpool. Ernest had just dissolved his partnership with</p><p>Miss Murphy having no prospects of keeping a wife.</p><p>15 24 Oct 2006</p><p>MS 760/1/175 Dec 1873</p><p>EAP was glad to hear that the &quot;Great Britian&quot; had arrived safely in</p><p>Melbourne because 'that naughty old lady Mrs Lovern [Press] had a a big</p><p>bag of sovereigns sewn around her neck.' He spoke of being alive to the</p><p>interests of old Mrs Press and her daughter Mrs Westcott who receivied a</p><p>bundle of bedding. [Sarah Westcott?]</p><p>He had been given two turkeys this year and a Stilton cheese, also five</p><p>pounds which he returned at once. The smaller turkey he gave away to the</p><p>Young mens. No days off for Christmas but an early finish.</p><p>MS 760/1/208 May 1874</p><p>Uncle Alfred and Auntie Annie [Press in Melbourne] are not well EAP</p><p>suggests the need for a quieter life [They owned the Yorkshire Hotel in</p><p>Collingwood but he had already died by the time this letter arrived.]</p><p>MS 760/1/235 1875</p><p>Aunt Annie retired from public [or should that be publican] life.</p><p>MS 760/1/236 March 1875</p><p>EAP received a note from George Rich and Mr Edwin Press informing him</p><p>that they were coming to London as witnesses for the Parlimentry</p><p>Committee on the Bridgewater Railway. Bridgewater to Edington [?] thence</p><p>over the Somerset line to Wells. EAP met them at Waterloo Station along</p><p>with ten or twelve other witnesses.</p><p>Sunday he went with Uncle [Edwin?] and Hobbs to hear Baldwin's discourse</p><p>on Future Life.</p><p>MS 760/1/238 March 1875</p><p>Affairs between Edwin, James [Jim] and Henry have improved.</p><p>Bessie Rich's baby was buried the day after EAP arrived [ at Burnham?].</p><p>Poor Bessie very weak.

Needed two</p><p>strong cups of tea to help digest a large sole and bread and butter.</p><p>MS 760/1/243 June 1875</p><p>Ernest Press spent a few days with EAP in London. He was there regarding</p><p>business in Manchester. EAP enjoyed the companionship. [ Rarely mentions</p><p>any friends or occupations except family and long hours of work.]</p><p>MS 760/1/247 June 1875</p><p>Dear Mother [Ann Press]</p><p>A chatty letter to his mother honouring the job she has done, what she has</p><p>faced and put up with, the privation she has suffered for her family. He</p><p>reports that in London they complain over very little things and no-one has a</p><p>good word to say of servants. They should know how to do for themselves!</p><p>He tells her of a croquet party and high tea at Lichfield House. He didn't</p><p>care to dance as he doesn't know how but he looked after the two Miss</p><p>Sangsters who were dressed alike. Several actors were there and Mr</p><p>Creswick Buckstone leasee of the &quot;HAYMARKET&quot;. [theatre?] EAP wore</p><p>an ordinary frock coat, white vest, light grey pants, dress boots and shirt with</p><p>gold studs, light blue tie, lavender kid gloves which he had worn to Jessie</p><p>Petherick's wedding.</p><p>He also went to the theatre and sat in the two shilling seats.</p><p>[I'm sorry there are not more letters to his mother he gives more personal</p><p>details to her.]</p><p>Thank Aunt Annie for the leaves and flowers from Uncle Alfred's grave.</p><p>He sent the views[?] on to Burnham. Uncle Henry thinks of framing them</p><p>before forwarding them to Edwin. He thinks of a doing many things, they all</p><p>16 24 Oct 2006</p><p>do!
