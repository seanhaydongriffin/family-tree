<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Your letter
of 1<sup>st</sup> instant to hand this morning.  I think my last letter must
have gone astray or else been delayed.  I wrote about two weeks ago and have
been awaiting a reply since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>You will see
by the above address that I have shifted. Two weeks ago today we left Mt. Gambier
and came straight through here via Adelaide spending a couple of days there. 
You will probably have received my last letter by the time this one reaches you
- I see your letter went to Mt Gambier and has been delayed a week.  Well I
think I mentioned that it was very dusty here, but since then it has rained -
it is still raining, and the station is just one big quagmire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Flying has
been cancelled due to the 'drome being too sticky. You can't imagine the amount
of mud, there is not one blade of grass around the huts - nothing but that
sticky red mud, churned up by lorries we and men and the builder still digging
trenches all over the place.  Even the tractors are bogged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>The weather
generally is much warmer than Melbourne and usually one can go out at night
without a great-coat, although the last couple of days have reminded me of Melbourne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>As things
stand at present we will be leaving Port Pirie in a couple of weeks to do one
month of astro-navigation at Mount gambier, commencing there on 28<sup>th</sup>
July.  Whether I will get enough time to get back to Melbourne between courses
remains to be seen, but I am still hoping.  As a matter of fact Morris Coath is
getting married then and he wants me to attend the wedding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>We have been
doing a bit of air to ground gunnery, that is shooting at targets on the ground
whilst flying past at about 150 mph.  Twice I held the record, but twice
someone else pipped mu score.  At one time I was Australasia champion air to
ground but now I am only second.  I was going up today to try and bust it open
but due to the weather we are stuck on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>There is not
much to write about really and it takes a long time to think up enough to put
in a letter.  All we do is work in the day time and sleep at night.  We sleep
on the floor on straw palliaces (?) and only today was the ridging put on the roof.  
Previously when it rained we had a small river in the centre of the hut and we
had to turn our bed on an angle to keep our toes out of then water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>So Margaret
and Gordon have shifted to Mentone.  It will be nice for the kiddies in the
summer time.  By your description it seems a very nice place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I haven't
received Ron's letter to date but perhaps it has gone to Mt. Gambier too, so I
will wait till I get it before writing to him I answered one of Don's letters
the same day as I sent yours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Well how are
you keeping and how is Dad? You didn't mention in your letter.  I am doing
fine; I had a bit of a cold a couple of weeks ago, which I have got rid of. 
The food on the station is one of the redeeming features and every one is
satisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>We have cereals
or porridge with hot or cold milk, <u>eggs</u> and <u>bacon </u>or sometimes
lamb's fry for breakfast.  Then often we have a 3 course meal for both dinner
and tea. It is well cooked and plenty of it.  Then we can have as much bread
and jam or honey as we like.  We usually get fruit once a day, but we can buy
beautiful big oranges at the canteen for 1d each. So I can eat about 4 or 5 f
those as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>But no matter
how much I eat I don't think I will ever get any fatter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I was flying
last Sunday but went to church in the evening.  On the whole they are a
different class of people than at Mt Gambier - instead of the rich squatter we
have the ordinary working man, mostly employed by the smelters, which is said
to be the biggest lead and silver smelting works in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>After church
we went around to the &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; club which is just new and opened
by the town's people for the benefit of men in uniform.  There we can play
table tennis, billiards, drafts etc, or just sit down and read. And at supper
time we can get nice sandwiches and scones with coffee for 4d.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>If the
weather clears up, as it looks like doing at present, I think I will go to the
pictures tonight - we usually go about twice a week as the lights are not good
enough at present for studying at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I will finish
now or else I won't have anything to write about next time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Trusting you are
both well and give my love to all the family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I am</p>

loving son</p>
