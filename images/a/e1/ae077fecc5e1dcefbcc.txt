Descendants of Thomas Press 

Generation No. 1 

1. THOMAS6 PRESS (JAMES5, JAMES4, WILLIAM3 PRESSE, FRANNCIS2 PRESS, MATHEW1 PRESSE) was 
born Abt. 1724 in Wiveliscombe, Somerset1, and died Abt. 1785 in Saint Decumans Parish, 
Somerset2. He married SARAH WILLIAMS 17 Feb 1750/51 in Saint Decumans Church, Watchet3,4, 
daughter of JOHN WILLIAMS and ELIZABETH WINTER. She was born Abt. 1727 in Saint Decumans 
Parish, Somerset, England5, and died 1803 in Saint Decumans Parish, Somerset6. 
Notes for THOMAS PRESS:
LDS FHL Film 1545306 Item 14 covering St. Decumans Parish Land Tax Assessment gives the
following information:


(B) Watchet 1766-1833 
1781 17 May :--- Watchet Borough: 
Land Owner: Lord Egrement 
Present Occupier: Thomas Press 
Taxation for Property called "Oldmans": 
Payment: 2 Shillings 0 Pence 

1782 :--- June as above 
1783 :--- 29 May as above 
1784 :--- 15 May as above 

After 1784 the occupier of "Oldmans" became John Flea and later Elizabeth Flea. In the early 1800's 
up to 1833 Mary Flea. 

Birth of Thomas Press: 
There is no definite proof that Thomas was the son of James & Margaret Press of Wiveliscombe. The 
marriage shown in the Bishop's Transcripts for St. Decumans also notes that Thomas Press was a 
Sojourner, therefore he could have been from Wiveliscombe. The 1st child born was named Margaret 
who later died and the 8th child born was also named Margaret. This could have been naming based 
on the name of his mother. The 7th child was named James which could have been based on his father. 
Later in St. Decumans there appears an Edward Press who marries Mary Moon, 27 Feb 1759. As far 
as I could ascertain no Press Surnames appeared in the St. Decumans Registers before Thomas & 
Edward Press.

Marriage Notes for THOMAS PRESS and SARAH WILLIAMS: 
It is obvious that some of the Parish Registers have been copied by hand some years after the original 
entries. The Bishops Transcripts, LDS FHL Film 1470994 Items 1 to 3, probably are much closer to 

1 24 Oct 2006 


the original register for the early years. 
This explains the differences between the filmed Register and the filmed Transcripts. For instance the 
filmed Register makes no mention of Thomas Press being a Sojourner, whereas the filmed Transcripts 
states Sojourner, probably because when the copy was written Thomas by that time was a long term 
resident of the Parish. The writing, spelling, and dates are also different in many cases.

 Matters concerning the PRESS FAMILY in Burnham, Somerset Eng. 
compiled from letters written by Edward Augustus PETHERICK from 
LONDON to his family in MELBOURNE during the period 1870 - 1877.


 Compiled by Pirrie K (Petherick) Shiel Jan 1994

 All the letters were addressed to his father Peter John Petherick unless

 otherwise stated. Compiler's comments eg [Press]

 E A Petherick had worked for the book seller George Robertson in 
Melbourne for 8 years, when at the age of 23 year, he was sent to England 
to manage the London office.

 MS 760/1/50 June 1870

 EAP left from Hobson's Bay, Victoria aboard the "GREAT BRITIAN" on 
15th June 1870. Uncle [Alfred Press ] came with EAP's father Peter John 
Petherick and EAP's younger brothers Ernest and Edgar to say good-bye.

 MS760/1/57 Sept 1870 
EAP went to Burnham, it cost 2 pound, visited PJP's mother's house [Mary 
Phillips Petherick] in Salmon Parade, near archway at Searle's. 
Sarah Ann, Bessie and Mariane Press went with him to Bridgewater.

 MS760/1/60 Nov 1870

 Henry Press' ship was wrecked but all hands saved.

 MS 760/1/68 Jan 1871

 Edwin and Jim [Press] have had a falling out. They have bought a boat 
together. Jim is enterprising. Edwin won't go out to look [for ships]. Jim goes 
to sea for a week looking for ships coming in. Jim makes up accounts 
regularly but Edwin doesn't. They take it in turns to pay the man they 
employ but Edwin is lax in keeping accounts. They are doing well but have 
difficulties over who is boss. Jim sacked the deckhand, Edwin said he could 
stay. Edwin was annoyed that Jim gave two guineas for repairing the 
Chapel. Jim wants to give up his share of the boat and is negotiating to sell 
off the "Dorset and Devon" and the adjoining house. He is thinking of going 
alone to Australia and to send for the others later. Jim and Sarah may go but 
SarahAnn will go into the shop with Richard. [?] 
Jim's son Tom is a good looking young fellow and it's a pity to see him and 
William shut up in Burnham and Wedmore. 
Henry has as much as he can do to look after and attend upon his wife.

 [Louise] He's very kind and 'soft'. He talks of Australia only his wife has fits 
so often. She had two or three severe attacks while EAP was in Burnham but 
should be better now for a month. The young Henry is very rough in his 
manner and courser in tone of voice than any of the family. 
Sarah Ann is very nice, kind and homely, too good. 
Edwin's two girls Mariane [Mary Ann] and Bessie [Elizabeth] are nice too. 
Mariane is most lady like, homely, thoughtful and diligent. EAP's favourite 
not excepting Charlotte. He feels at home with them. 
Aunt Sarah [Jim's wife] is sweet, speaks as if she is out of breath. Aunt Ann 

12 24 Oct 2006 


 [Edwin's wife] is motherly, has to "talk to the boys when necessary". [scolds] 
"Uncle Nicholas" is getting rich with lots of houses.

 MS 760/1/74 
Copy of James Press Senior's will sent. [To PJP?]

 MS 760/1/83 May 1871 
[EAP refers to] Aunt Annie and Uncle Alfred [Press] in Melbourne.

 MS 760/1/94 Aug/Sept 1871 
EAP in Burnham again and discribes the view from Aunt Ann's window. 
He writes in her accent, Bessie and Mariane are reading and he is writing.

 MS 760/1/129 Sept 1872 
Uncle Jim [Press] told how Harry lost the Cardiff steamer- not his fault but 
he was the captain. The engine-driver was drunk, she turned on her side and 
broke into pieces. Henry nearly drowned. 'Another misfortune for young 
Henry!' Uncle Edwin is now piloting the boats across. Don't know what 
Henry does. 
Harry [Captain Henry] lost the "FLORA" [is Flora the Cardiff ateamer?] 
Uncle James' broken rib has mended. 
Polly (Mariane) has gone to Bridgewater, Aunt Lousie [Uncle Henry wife] 
has introduced her to the large drapery warehouse there. A L is a good 
business woman in spite of her attacks. [?]

 MS 760/1/131 
To Mother 
EAP in Burnham and Bridgewater again visited Aunt Eliza Press [?] and 
Aunt Nicholas with Tom. Her son was a grocer, now a carpenter. EAP 
called at 2 Julia Terrace and talked with Mrs Walter Board upstairs in the 
drawing room over looking the sea.

 MS 760/1/136 
Uncle Edwin away on the Cardiff steamer. Uncle Jim obliged to stay home 
idle as there is no second pilot boat. No-one will work for jim as it is not 
perminent because the boat is shared with Edwin. 
Uncle Jim Aunt Sarah, Tom and Sarah to have a bootshop. 
Uncle Henry still works as a pilot and must go out at least once or twice a 
year to keep his certificate. 
The Press family has started a Good Temple of total abstainers and they 
want to enforce it on others. The Lodge is called "Resque of Burnham"- the 
edge of the bottomless pit. 
EAP jokes about it [not suprising since his father owns a hotel in 
Melbourne] and refers to 
the PRESS GANG 
Henry Press -president 
Tom Press -secretary 
W J Press -worthy right-hand supporter [g.g.grandfather to Kate's husband] 
Bessie Press -worthy left-hand supporter 
Charlotte Press -something else 
Mary Ann press -removed to Bridgewater 
Sarah Ann won't have anything to do with it. 
"But the Press' aren't all Burnham, happily so, and Aunt Ann do have her half 
pint."

 Oct 1872

 Tom Press has come to London and gained employment at a grocer house as 
an assistant at Kingsland London Nth at 20 pound per anum with board and 
lodging. Its a first class place with no drudgery, storemen grind the coffee 
and break the sugar.

 MS 760/1/149 Dec 1872 
Christmas in London with Tom. He shared my bed. [!!!] A turkey was sent

 MS 760/1/164 Sept 1873 
EAP holidayed at Burnham and went to Watchet for the first time to see St 
Andrews, the castle and park, the model farm of Sir Alex Hood at eve and by 
night to Williton. The Old Cleeve Abbey now rotting as a piggery then 
around the seashore by the Blue Anchor. John and Thomas Press entertained 
me during the Watchet trip. The air was clear between showers and I could 
see the Welch coast. Also I could see Burnham from Minehead about 23 
miles and was able to distinguish Uncle Edwin's house on Royal Parade. In 
the evening the reflection on his windows was as brillant as the nearby light 
house on 'The Holmes.' 
Mrs Kingsbury ( nee Slocombe of Watchet) was with Charlotte who was 
nursing a tiny twin several months old. The baby was even smaller than at 
birth according to Aunt Sarah and died within afew days [Aug 1873] 
He put up [stayed] with Aunt Lou's with Uncle Henry as valet. Henry took 
EAP out in the boat as did Uncle Edwin and Jim in the 'Petrel'. 
While at Watchet he saw Mrs Woodland and she talked of the twin born 
girls. [ Were these Charlotte's ?] 
Aunt Nancy's husband, who ever he maybe was in Thomas Press' shop in 
Watchet. 
Mariane was home Sunday to attend the Temple tea-meeting. 
Henry has built the Templer Hotel at Burnham. Uncle Edwin has taken the 
pledge and Uncle Henry is the only brother "untied". He doesn't drink but 
won't sign the pledge. Aunty Ann still has her 'two penneth'. 
Bessie is going out [?] as soon as possible and Aunt Ann and Uncle Edwin 
will be left alone with only servants. 
Mr Wiggins [?] is well and keeps a shop to eke out his existance, in our old 
shop. [PJPetherick's shop in Burnham] 
EAP called on old Mrs Press [formerly Lovern ?] She intends going to 
Australia in the near future. Uncle Henry spoke to her the other day, the only 
time since grandfather died [James Press?] She is not on visiting terms with 
either Aunt Sarah or Aunt Ann now that neither one ask her to have a beer. 
Uncle Edwin and Jim's old house is in a disgraceful state having not been 
done up for years, the walls are black.


 MS 760/1/171 
EAP send peacock feathers from Uncle Jim's peacocks, home to the girls.


 MS 760/1/173 Oct 1873 
Old Mrs Press is leaving on 24th Oct aboard the "Great Britian".

Miss Murphy having no prospects of keeping a wife.


14 24 Oct 2006 


 MS 760/1/175 Dec 1873 
EAP was glad to hear that the "Great Britian" had arrived safely in 
Melbourne because 'that naughty old lady Mrs Lovern [Press] had a a big 
bag of sovereigns sewn around her neck.' He spoke of being alive to the 
interests of old Mrs Press and her daughter Mrs Westcott who receivied a 
bundle of bedding. [Sarah Westcott?] 
He had been given two turkeys this year and a Stilton cheese, also five 
pounds which he returned at once. The smaller turkey he gave away to the 
Young mens. No days off for Christmas but an early finish.


 MS 760/1/208 May 1874 
Uncle Alfred and Auntie Annie [Press in Melbourne] are not well EAP 
suggests the need for a quieter life [They owned the Yorkshire Hotel in 
Collingwood but he had already died by the time this letter arrived.]


 MS 760/1/235 1875 
Aunt Annie retired from public [or should that be publican] life. 
MS 760/1/236 March 1875 
EAP received a note from George Rich and Mr Edwin Press informing him 
that they were coming to London as witnesses for the Parlimentry 
Committee on the Bridgewater Railway. Bridgewater to Edington [?] thence 
over the Somerset line to Wells. EAP met them at Waterloo Station along 
with ten or twelve other witnesses. 
Sunday he went with Uncle [Edwin?] and Hobbs to hear Baldwin's discourse 
on Future Life.


 MS 760/1/238 March 1875 
Affairs between Edwin, James [Jim] and Henry have improved. 
Bessie Rich's baby was buried the day after EAP arrived [ at Burnham?]. 
Poor Bessie very weak. He went to Bridgewater by one of Harry's ships. 
George Rich went with me to Church [as distinct from chapel] Polly Lilly 
there, later stopped of at his shop"York House". 
Stopped with Uncle Edwin and Aunt Ann at Esplanade House. Needed two 
strong cups of tea to help digest a large sole and bread and butter.


 MS 760/1/243 June 1875 
Ernest Press spent a few days with EAP in London. He was there regarding 
business in Manchester. EAP enjoyed the companionship. [ Rarely mentions 
any friends or occupations except family and long hours of work.]


 MS 760/1/247 June 1875 
Dear Mother [Ann Press]


 A chatty letter to his mother honouring the job she has done, what she has 
faced and put up with, the privation she has suffered for her family. He 
reports that in London they complain over very little things and no-one has a 
good word to say of servants. They should know how to do for themselves! 
He tells her of a croquet party and high tea at Lichfield House. He didn't 
care to dance as he doesn't know how but he looked after the two Miss 
Sangsters who were dressed alike. Several actors were there and Mr 
Creswick Buckstone leasee of the "HAYMARKET". [theatre?] EAP wore 
an ordinary frock coat, white vest, light grey pants, dress boots and shirt with 
gold studs, light blue tie, lavender kid gloves which he had worn to Jessie 
Petherick's wedding. 
He also went to the theatre and sat in the two shilling seats. 
[I'm sorry there are not more letters to his mother he gives more personal 
details to her.] 
Thank Aunt Annie for the leaves and flowers from Uncle Alfred's grave. 
He sent the views[?] on to Burnham. Uncle Henry thinks of framing them 
before forwarding them to Edwin. He thinks of a doing many things, they all

 do! The albums for Rosa and Bessie [EAP'S sisters] are still in the shop 
unbought and probably will remain so!


 MS 760/1/253 Aug 1875 
EAP went for a trip to Belgium, Germany, the latest battlefields, and Paris 
He was invited to the Isle Of Wight [by Sangsters?]but felt he couldn't go 
because Miss Cable was going and she is a very nice girl could not have her 
name mixed up with Edward. People 'talk' more in England than in Australia.


 MS 760/1/257 Oct 1875 
This is a letter were EAP remember things from his early life in Burnham and 
Melbourne. He claims he never forgets anything, although he does admit to 
not remember much about his grandfather [which one?] except that when 
they were leaving he gave them pence and EAP fancies new shoes as well.


 MS 760/1/265 Dec 1875 
EAP did jury service from 1st -7th Dec1875 and earned three guineas which 
rightly belongs to George Robertson his employer, as he EAP, belongs to 
Robertson. EAP doesn't wish to earn any other money but does decice to 
keep it. He was impanelled on three cases but had little to do as two cases 
were unsuited. [Uncontested?] 
One was a breach of promise and the plaintive got 500 pounds and the 
lawyer 100 pounds. 
Miss Cable engaged, [EAP missed again] she was very suitable and much 
admired by Edward. "Another chance lost! Such is life!" he wonders if he 
should have gone to the Isle of Wight. he does not intend marrying before he 
is thirty but perhaps if he had told her maybe she would have waited. 
Regrets.


 MS 760/1/280 June 1876 
Uncle James and Aunt Sarah [Press] came to London. Uncle James gave 
evidence to Comm. of House of Commons on the Highbridge Dock. 
Aunt Sarah has a sister Mrs Wood. 
Regards to Aunt Mary, [Press] Aunt Annie, [Press] and her mother [Mrs

 He askes for Miss Caroline (Carrie) Bunney's hand in marriage. [She is in 
Melbourne and he hasn't seen her for six years. He may have asked sooner 
but didn't out of respect to the Foggo family and Sarah his first love who 
died in 1874 after a long illness. EAP had planned for her to join him.]

16 24 Oct 2006 


 EAP is confused and frustrated about his family's attitude to his well being 
and compares it to the families at Burnham where there is disagreement and a 
failiure to work together. They have as good as, lost their claim on the ship 
they saved, to the owner and Insurance company. [ Details about the 
salvage/ Court of Admiralty court case followed.] Harry, Uncle Edwin, 
Uncle Jim and their men only got 350 pounds covering expenses.

 MS 760/1/330 July 1877 
EAP withdrew his proposal at Carrie's suggestion. He is very upset. Family 
failed to inform him of the "true state of her mind and habits [What could 
they be.] and I was obliged to withdraw from a most irksome engagment." 
There is alot of confusion with his father, over the money he has sent home 
during the last seven years, which he now wants to put into a partnership. 
There is not nearly as much available as he was led to believe.

 MS 760/1/341 Sept 1877 
EAP finally starts for home aboard the "CUZCO"

 My Dear Father 27th Sept 1877 
Mr William Petherick came down from Gravesend with the steamer to see 
me off. I left Burnham yesterday for Highgate, there was a large party in the 
afternoon at Uncle Jim's. Sarah Ann [Press] very unwell and unable to 
walk, I fear she may not recover -lungs. I arrived at Plymouth and stayed at 
the "Duke of Cornwell" hotel. 
With all the love I can express to all and for all, 
I remain your most affectionate son,

 Edward. 
I will telegraph to you via Adelaide upon my arrival at that Port.

11. EDWIN9 PRESS (JAMES8, JAMES7, THOMAS6, JAMES5, JAMES4, WILLIAM3 PRESSE, FRANNCIS2 PRESS, 
MATHEW1 PRESSE) was born 06 Mar 1821 in Bridgwater, Somerset, England285,286, and died 29 Dec 
1893 in Williamstown, (Sorrento), Victoria, Australia287,288. He married ANN PALMER 29 Apr 1843 
in Sion Chapel, Bridgwater, Somerset289. She was born Abt. 1819 in Huntspill, Somerset, England290, 
and died 17 May 1883 in Burnham, Somerset291,292. 
Notes for EDWIN PRESS: 
Apparently Edwin Press must have emigrated to Australia after his wife Ann died and was buried in 
Burnham, Somerset. She was buried 23 May 1883 at the age of 63 years. Edwin & wife are shown in 
the 1881 Burnham census, although his age is shown incorrectly as 66 years. His wife was shown as 
Fanny Press, age 60 years, & born in Huntspill. I estimate that Edwin emigrated between 1883 to 1885 
to Australia. 
According to the Kate Press E mail to Roy Eugene Nicholas, dated 29 June 2003, a Headstone in 
Melbourne General Cemetery shows Edwin Press, father of Henry, died 29 Dec 1893, age 72 years. 
In the same E mail is the mention of a Melbourne Newspaper notice - the Argus. "Sat 30th Dec 1893 
Pilot Edwin died 28th at Portsea (near Sorrento), Port Philip Bay, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia". 
Apparently there is also a memorial to Edwin in St. Andrews church, Burnham.

Notes for HENRY PALMER PRESS: 
MAY 1909 

Note: Comment by John Clark, "Captain Henry Press went to Watchet on Thursday 20 May 1909. He 
wrote in his diary": 

..saw Capt John Watts late Harbour Master John Nicholas ??? ???? ??? to make for & if they 
didn't want me, to go to Lees, but Jane & her daughter Clara soon had me & I felt at ease. After dinner 

25 24 Oct 2006 


John & I took a little walk and I went down to sketch some rocks, my principal object in going there. 
Then met Alf Nicholas & lots of others. 

Friday 
Up before the house was astir & about, then back to breakfast, spent most of the morning with Alf 
Nicholas who is a Churchwarden & had the keys of the documents etc etc at St Decuman's. We were 
there soon after 10 & stayed until close on 1. Found Grandfathers entry of his Baptism etc. James son 
of James and Mary Press April 27 1795, also his brother Henry Oct 16 1796 & sister Ann Bryson July 
8 1798 (Jim Nicholas' mother) & a Christian daughter June 8 1799, Henry and Christian and their 
mother must have died as in 1800 March a Henry son Elizabeth & James Press was born, we had not 
time to see all the deaths etc. This Henry must have also died, one Henry Press buried on April 24 
1803 & Henry Press on Oct 19 1800 and a Mary Press on Oct 8. I hope to visit Watchet again to 
complete and then tabulate them & find out 'who's who'. The same evening I walked with Alf Organ, a 
son-in-law of John Nicholas, over to Blue Anchor to see his son Simon, he has two large houses which 
they let in the summer and three large fields & gardens, keep cows poultry etc and sends milk & eggs 
every morning 
to his mother & she sells it. Just as it was getting dark, 'Sim' harnessed his cob to a real nice turnout & 
drove us back to Watchet, taking his little girl, who stays there all the week for school, back with him. 

Saturday 
Up early & out for a walk & after breakfast out on the rocks. Called on a few people, the day before I 
called at the corner shop to ask about Daisy Downton & was invited into the old old kitchen, saw the 
Lees, Llewelyn Hole, John Lewis & Sally Potter & others. At 10.30 with Alf Nicholas & Harry 
Kingsbury & 
followed after by Bob Nicholas we walked up to 'Five Bells' to wait for Will who was to be there at 

11. 
About a quarter past he turned up. & we soon took our departure, we overtook Will Lee who had left 
before on his bike, had a nice run to Dunster & on towards Cutcombe having decided to make 
Torridge 
at the same time, we now go close to the Taw, saw Fremington etc pass Barnstaple & on for South 
Moulton again, going up a hill or trying to get up, we came to a place where was ??? of new 
metal, we had been warned. She got through about 3/4 of it when she stopped - the road makers 
helping. At South Moulton we stopped to see an old employee of Will's then on through Brompton, 
Milverton to Wivelscombe pulled up at the vicarage soon after one then I visit the vicar Mr Pruiet till 
half past four. I 
found mention of our sires from 1577 from the time they first kept record first wedding 1594 last 
1750. 
Last baptism 1760 First 1589. Leaving Wivelscombe we soon travel to Taunton, through the old town 
and on to Bridgwater (as we passed Petherton we sent a telegram) then on, at Highbridge to avoid a 
collision we ran into & scraped a wall, tore our axle cap, getting here before the telegram came. 
Note: Comment by John Clark, "After spending 2 nights at Ilfracombe the diary proceeds:"


Next day Empire Day (24/5/1909).
Leaving the town at 10am, oh it was grand thro' the valleys & when at Braunton we could see

The original diary was in the possession of John Clark, grandson of Capt. Henry, & a copy of some of 
the pages were sent to Max Press who in turn sent a copy to me.

Notes for HENRY PALMER PRESS: 
MAY 1909 

Note: Comment by John Clark, "Captain Henry Press went to Watchet on Thursday 20 May 1909. He 
wrote in his diary": 

..saw Capt John Watts late Harbour Master John Nicholas ??? ???? ??? to make for & if they 
didn't want me, to go to Lees, but Jane & her daughter Clara soon had me & I felt at ease. After dinner 
John & I took a little walk and I went down to sketch some rocks, my principal object in going there. 
Then met Alf Nicholas & lots of others. 

Friday 
Up before the house was astir & about, then back to breakfast, spent most of the morning with Alf 
Nicholas who is a Churchwarden & had the keys of the documents etc etc at St Decuman's. We were 
there soon after 10 & stayed until close on 1. Found Grandfathers entry of his Baptism etc. James son 
of James and Mary Press April 27 1795, also his brother Henry Oct 16 1796 & sister Ann Bryson July 
8 1798 (Jim Nicholas' mother) & a Christian daughter June 8 1799, Henry and Christian and their 
mother must have died as in 1800 March a Henry son Elizabeth & James Press was born, we had not 
time to see all the deaths etc. This Henry must have also died, one Henry Press buried on April 24 
1803 & Henry Press on Oct 19 1800 and a Mary Press on Oct 8. I hope to visit Watchet again to 
complete and then tabulate them & find out 'who's who'. The same evening I walked with Alf Organ, a 
son-in-law of John Nicholas, over to Blue Anchor to see his son Simon, he has two large houses which 
they let in the summer and three large fields & gardens, keep cows poultry etc and sends milk & eggs 
every morning 
to his mother & she sells it. Just as it was getting dark, 'Sim' harnessed his cob to a real nice turnout & 
drove us back to Watchet, taking his little girl, who stays there all the week for school, back with him. 

Saturday 
Up early & out for a walk & after breakfast out on the rocks. Called on a few people, the day before I 
called at the corner shop to ask about Daisy Downton & was invited into the old old kitchen, saw the 
Lees, Llewelyn Hole, John Lewis & Sally Potter & others. At 10.30 with Alf Nicholas & Harry 
Kingsbury & 
followed after by Bob Nicholas we walked up to 'Five Bells' to wait for Will who was to be there at 

11. 
About a quarter past he turned up. & we soon took our departure, we overtook Will Lee who had left 
before on his bike, had a nice run to Dunster & on towards Cutcombe having decided to make

at the same time, we now go close to the Taw, saw Fremington etc pass Barnstaple & on for South
Moulton again, going up a hill or trying to get up, we came to a place where was ??? of new
metal, we had been warned. She got through about 3/4 of it when she stopped - the road makers
helping. At South Moulton we stopped to see an old employee of Will's then on through Brompton,
Milverton to Wivelscombe pulled up at the vicarage soon after one then I visit the vicar Mr Pruiet till
half past four. I
found mention of our sires from 1577 from the time they first kept record first wedding 1594 last
1750.
Last baptism 1760 First 1589. Leaving Wivelscombe we soon travel to Taunton, through the old town
and on to Bridgwater (as we passed Petherton we sent a telegram) then on, at Highbridge to avoid a
collision we ran into & scraped a wall, tore our axle cap, getting here before the telegram came.

The original diary was in the possession of John Clark, grandson of Capt. Henry, & a copy of some of

Marriage Notes for ALFRED NICHOLAS and PHOEBE LAVER: 
The Marriage Certificate Number MX 526154, Church Marriage Number 130, shows the marriage of 
Phoebe Leaver to Alfred James Nicholas. A search of the Birth Indexes for the birth of Phoebe Leaver 
by the General Register Office, St. Catherines House, and for the years 1863 to 1867 inclusive found 
no trace of a Phoebe Leaver. Nor was a trace of her brother Daniel Leaver found in a following search. 
The family name of Leaver was shown in the 1871 Census of Taunton but a further search of the 1861 
Census of Taunton revealed the actual name for the same family as Laver. Over a period of time 
during different Censuses the name is shown either as Laver, Leaver, or Lever. Future birth 
certificates of the children of Alfred James and Phoebe Nicholas show the mother's maiden name as 
Leaver and in one instance Laver.

In the 1901 Census, RG 13/2263, Folio 28, Page 11, Schedule 66, Market Street, Watchet, Simon is 
living in the household of his grandmother Maria Wedlake. He was enumerated in error as Simon 
Wedlake nephew of Maria. His wife Pauline had been enumerated in error as Pauline R Wedlake with 
his daughter enumerated in error as Edith F Wedlake, granddaughter of Maria. His sister was 
enumerated in error as Clara Wedlake, niece of Maria. In all cases except for Maria Wedlake the 
surname should have been Nicholas. Also they were grandson, wife of grandson, great-grandaughter, 
& grandaughter respectively. Maria Wedlake at the time of enumeration was 86 years old & probably 
poor in memory as well as confused.
