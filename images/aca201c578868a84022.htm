<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Well we are
getting some Melbourne weather here.  It started raining Thursday night and
hasn't stopped since.  The grounds where we do our physical training is three
feet under water, but our parade ground is just mud so we can't drill. We do
Morse Code instead. The railway line has been washed away between Victor
Harbour and Adelaide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Last Wednesday
afternoon it was terrifically hot and we were having sport on the golf links
about half a mile away when the fire alarm siren rang at the camp.  We had to
drop everything and run for our lives up hill and when we got there found it
was just a little joke to see how quickly we would answer. It is an order that
as soon as we hear the siren we have to run to the parade ground n matter where
we are, even down in the town, and believe me it is a loud siren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Thanks for
the photos; Ron wrote to me before he went to Seymour.  About my motor cycle
licence, I don't want it to let it run out because I will want to use it if I
come home on leave, so would you send a 5/- postal note with the licence to
Motor Reg. Branch.  There is no need to tell them my address as my private
address is still Drewett St. The post office here is never open when we get
leave so I can't get one myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I got 96% in
the Maths test last week and 100% today and the Commanding Officer had me
paraded before him and he asked me how I was liking the place, and was I happy
etc. and had quite a little chat. He did this to only one other chap in the
flight, a chap named Jones, and a personal friend of mine.  We went to church
together last Sunday night and going again tomorrow if it clears up a bit (n.b.
with Jones, not the CO).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>There were
three chaps in our flight who failed in their test, two who were made gunners,
and the other, who was named Seppelt (son of Seppelt of Seppelt Wines) was
dismissed, so you can see they keep you up to the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>It is a
terrible day today, strong winds and driving rain, and looking out of the door
there is ahuge sea rolling in and crashing over the breakwater. Looking out of
the window the Hindmarsh River is in flood and where it enters the sea the
water is muddy and tossing about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>The other day
we all had our photos taken for record purposes and I am enclosing a copy of
one.  It is not a good photo, but it cost nothing. We also had one taken of the
flight; these cost 3/- each so I am getting one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>It is much
cooler out in the huts but we have five blankets each.  I only use 4 and one is
for a pillow with the blue kit bag they gave us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>We get a
variety of jobs here that it is impossible to become monotonous.  We have to
make our beds, fold our blankets in the correct manner, clean our boots, sweep
and dust the hut as well as clean the window.  On Monday night it is what we
call panic night.  All floors have to be <u>scrubbed,</u> all windows cleaned,
door handles polished, electric light shades cleaned and a Host of tother
things.  Then apart from studying Maths, Morse code, Air Force Law, armaments,
gas, medical, drill, physical training and swimming etc, we get what s called
fatigue.  That is, have to clean up the garden and dozens of other jobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>My
vaccination did not break out and up to date have not affected me.  The medical
officer inspected our arms yesterday and seems satisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>We are going
to the pictures tonight, &quot;The Beachcomber&quot;, with Chas Laughton, is
on.   They get pictures here about 6 months after Melbourne, but I think I can
see it twice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>I will finish
now as I've got a law book with 984 pages that I want to study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:20.9pt;text-align:justify'>Trusting you
is both well and looking after yourselves.</p>
