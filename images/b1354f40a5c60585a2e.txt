Dear Sean,
 
Thank you for your email, I think that Mary Doyle is part of my family 
tree also as my ancestors came from County Clare also.
 
Mary Doyle Married Thomas Hehir  they  had a son Patrick Hehir  who 
married a Margaret Tracy or Treacey, their  Daughter Margaret Hehir (my 
Grandmother) married Ernest Samuel Mitchell. They lived in Footscray 
Victoria and their daughter (my Mother) was Leila Mitchell.
 
The connection you gave for more information did not seem to work, so any 
information would be gratefully recieved.
 
sincerely,
 
Valerie Bracks
