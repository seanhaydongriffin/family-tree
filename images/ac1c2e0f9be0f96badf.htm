<li><em>Note:</em> <blockquote>From the Walker Newsletter #5, December 1998............<br>THOMAS WALKER 1859 - 1932<br>Thomas Walker was baptised on 24 May 1865 at Broughton Creek when he was almost 6 years old.  His sister Sarah, almost 5 and brother John aged 3 and a half were also baptised the same day at broughton Creek.  He was named after his paternal Grandfather Thomas Walker a Thatcher by trade.<br>Little is known of the early life of Thomas jnr except that he saw his mother die when he was only 8, his father taking a second wife in the same year of his mother's death.  seven years later his father died.  Thomas was now just one month off turning 15, a young working man in the year of 1874.<br>What Thomas did then until his enlistment in the New South Wales  Australia, AustraliaPermanent Artillery Regiment about 1884 is unknown.  This regiment was a volunteer regiment.<br>Five years later Thomas gained the rank of Sergeant and obtained the First Class Certificate at the School of Gunnery on 21 Dec 1889.  This 'School' eas located at Middle Head.  The following year he was appointed as Battery Sergeant Major and posted to Fort Scratchley in Newcastle where he remained until March 1895.<br>It was in Newcastle that Thomas met and married Elizabeth Jane BEAL, who was born in Arsenal, Woolwich in England.  They married at the Christ Church, Newcastle on 27th January 1891.  The witnesses were James W Beal, Mary E B Perry and Eleanor Beal.  Their first 2 children Elizabeth and John were both born while their father was stationed at Fort Scratchley.<br>The year 1896 saw Thomas make the move with his family back to Sydney where he was stationed at Georges Heights.  this meant a reduction in rank to Sergeant and probably a reduction in pay but ensured a secure home for his young family.  thomas would have been responsible for the care and maintenance of the artillery batteries at Georges Heights and Middle Head.<br>Thomas and Elizabeth's 3rd child, Thomas was born at Georges Heights on the 2nd November 1897.<br>On the 20th January 1898, thomas received a &quot;Long Service and Good Conduct Medal&quot;.  The presentation took place at the general pararde of the Permanent Foreces at Victoria Barracks.  This was the first parade of its kind held in New South Wales  Australia.  The Medals wer presented by Major General G French, CMG, RA, Commandant of the New South Wales  Australia, AustraliaForces.  Three Warrant Officers received the Meritorious Service Medal and Nine members - including Sergeant Walker (aged 39) - received the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. [I tried checking the newspapers for this event with no result.]<br>In August of the same year the Reserve Magazine at Newington was handed over to the Artillery Regiment and placed in charge of steady married soldiers.  In September the first powder was stored there.  The date of Thomas' posting to Newington is not listed but it is thought he was one of the first group there.<br>As a result of the formation of the Australian Commonwealth in 1901, all State Military Forces were amalgamated.  On the 10 July 1902 the New South Wales  Australia, AustraliaForces were reorganised.  On 15 September 1902 Sergeant Walker, Gunners G Jennings, T Campbell and W Clarke employed at the Newington magazine were transferred to the Ordnance Store Corps. <br>From 1903 - 1919. Thomas Walker is listed in the Sands Directory for Sydney, living at the Magazine Reserve, Auburn.  He retired about 1921 though there is no record of his date of discharge from the Army.  Having lived in Army quarters Thomas' family (including sone Thomas and Daughter Emily May) now made the family home in Sutherland St, Lidcombe (later Auburn).  The house was named 'Milton'.<br><br>Thomas died on the 23rd January 1932 aged 72.  he is buried in rookwood Cemetery, Church of England.<br>It is a double grave, wherein his wife Elizabeth was also laid to rest on 7th July 1950 aged 80. Their 2 sons John and Thomas are also there.  John died in 1919 aged 25; Thomas 1966 aged 69.<br>Of Thomas and Elizabeth's daughters, Elizabeth married in 1911 Thomas Wilfred George GORDON (6 Children) and Emily May born in 1909 married Alex EASTON (1 son).<br>My grandfather told me about his Uncle Thomas (i.e. his mother Annie Maria LEE nee Walker's brother).  He said Tom was in the Army all his life but never went to war.  That one sentence fuelled my curiosity to discover if there was any truth in it and resulted in the above information about Thomas Walker and his family.       SUE HEWITT.</blockquote><BR>
