<li><em>Name:</em> Thomas WALKER
<li><em>Sex:</em> M
<li><em>Birth:</em>  ABT. 1806 in Almondsbury, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND
<li><em>Note:</em> <blockquote>From the Walker Newsletter #2, June 1997........<br>HISTORICAL CORNER.<br>THOMAS WALKER Snr was the father of our John Walker.  When John married in 1853 in Gloucestershire, England, he gave his father's occupation as &quot;Thatcher&quot;.  This was a specialised craft and the methods of roof thatching varied from county to county.  the craft was often passed from father to son.  It was a lour intensive job, hard on hands which were protected, by a thick lather strap, from injury when driving the pegs used to hold the thatch in place.  When railways brought tiles from Wales to England, and threshing machines and combine harvesters mad farming crops unsuitable for thatching, the art of thatching was less in demand.  When John arrive din Australia in 1855, he gave his occupation as Ag. Lab. (i.e. Agricultural Labourer). I'd first thought this meant farming the land, but perhaps he turned to farming after realising thatching had limited job opportunities.</blockquote><BR><br><em>Marriage</em> 1
