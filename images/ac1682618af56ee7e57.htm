Sir William Molesworth:<br>
Early on the morning of Monday, October 11th 1852 William Calder made his way 
to the Glasgow docks in order to join the ship &quot;Sir William Molesworth&quot; 
for the voyage to Australia.
<p>The ship was barque of 468 tons built in Nova Scotia in 1848. Her dimensions 
  are given as 108 x 19 x 26 ft. In the 1852 edition of Lloyd's Register of British 
  and Foreign Shipping she is described as being constructed of beech, spruce 
  and pine, sheathed with felt and zinc and partly iron bound. She had been classified 
  as A1 from the time she was built and was obviously well found. At the time 
  of the entry her owners were noted as Reid &amp; Co., and her port of registration 
  was Glasgow. She had been sailing on the route between the Clyde and New York. 
  On this voyage, however, she had new owners; the passengers themselves. They 
  called themselves the &quot;Christian Temperance Emigration Association&quot;, 
  and the management of affairs was conducted by a Committee out of their own 
  number. Her captain, Captain J. Watt. She carried 265 passengers.</p>
<p>Whether this practice of the passengers owning the ship occurred on other occasions 
  is not known. The ship was sold after arrival in Australia to Mr. A. W. Hill 
  and H. A. Coffey, and soon after leased to a firm who carried on a ship repair 
  and chandlers business at Williamstown. Some time in the 1860&#146;s she was 
  hulked, and in 1870 a half interest was sold to Captain James Deane and two 
  others who used the vessel as a coal hulk. It was while serving in this capacity 
  that she caught fire at Williamstown on 8th October 1871 and was totally destroyed.</p>
<p>There is an account of the voyage in the LaTrobe Library at the State Library 
  of Victoria written by Mark Addison (MS 8877). I have transcribed this into 
  a Word7 document.</p>
