<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>AUS 401265 Pilot
Officer Allan F.A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Born in Melbourne May 9<sup>th</sup> 1917</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Died Nakuru, Kenya, January 23<sup>rd</sup> 1942, aged 24 years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Fergus Allan was the second son
and fourth child of David Lindsay ALLAN (born in Melbourne 1874, died Adelaide
1957) and Lena Thorne ALLAN (nee PRESS, born 1880 in Watchet, Somerset, died Melbourne
1943).  He had two older sisters Margaret Elizabeth BILLING and Hazel Lindsay
WOMERSLEY, and an older brother Donald Lindsay ALLAN.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In 1941 he enlisted in the RAAF
and did initial training at Victor Harbour (SA), Mt Gambier (SA) and Port Pirie
(SA) before being sent to Egypt, then Kenya to train as a navigator with the
RAF.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>These letters were kept and
treasured by my mother Margaret until her death in 1994. As I was updating some
details on our family tree I remembered these letters and read them with a
mixture of sadness and delight, especially the later ones written &quot;On
Active Service&quot;.  In a poignant, and in hindsight an oddly prescient
comment, written only weeks before he was killed, Fergus remarked on the beauty
of that part of Africa where he was stationed and wrote that he would like to
stay there for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In 1989 my husband and I
travelled to East Africa, located and visited the graves of my uncle, Fergus,
and the other two young men (George Emery and Allen Hawkins, both of SA) who
had died in the plane crash.  To my distress the first time we had been taken
to the Nakuru War Cemetery we could not locate the grave.  It turned out that
that particular cemetery was for casualties of the war of independence,
commonly known as the Mau Mau War, in the 1950s.  It was only afterwards,
having contacted the British High Commission in Nairobi, that we given the
correct information.  We had hired a car and driver to take us from Nairobi to
Nakuru a second time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It was good to see that the
graves were well tended after so many years, in a section of the Nakuru General
Cemetery set aside as a Commonwealth War Cemetery.  In the loose soil around
the grave I buried a small brooch of my grandmother's and scattered the dried
rose petals and rosemary I had carried from my mother's garden in Adelaide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Africa is a strange and beautiful
country, and after a time there one ceases to be surprised at odd coincidences. 
Our driver accompanied us into the cemetery, although he seemed a little
spooked at walking among the graves.  Then, when we found Fergus' grave, and I
read the inscription aloud, the eyes of our tall dark and very handsome driver
almost popped out of his head. It was as if a ghost had passed by and, when I
questioned him, he muttered that the date of my uncle's death was his birthday
and the actual the day he had been born, in Nakuru!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am glad that I was the first,
and probably the only likely member of the family to pay my respects at his
last resting-place. I had always felt a strange kinship with my uncle, and as I
read his letters I learned to my surprise that we had travelled over many of
the same paths.   I have spent time in both Port Pirie and Victor Harbour and I
had a year teaching at Mount Gambier, where one of my pupils was a Brenton
Kilsby, possibly son and grandson of my uncle's friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> I too had sailed from Perth to
the Middle East on my way to England in 1964, the ship calling at Colombo
(Ceylon) and Aden and as the ship passed through the Suez Canal I took a trip
to Cairo and Ismailia.   I rode a camel to the Sphinx and entered the Pyramid
of Cheops, to view the King's burial chamber too. We wandered through the
bazaars and spent time admiring the Alabaster Mosque overlooking the city.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Perhaps too, this rapport had
been instilled unconsciously by my mother who had cared for Fergus as a baby. 
She became almost a surrogate mother as my grandmother, who had suffered with
rheumatic fever as a younger person, was frail with indifferent health after
the birth of her fourth child. After the shock of the sudden death of Fergus my
grandmother survived little more than another year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Another other odd experience I
had was when I began reading and transcribing these letters.   I realised that
the date was January 23<sup>rd</sup> 2003, 62 years to the day since his
death.  Ironically, too, Fergus had died on his sister Hazel's birthday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>And finally, my daughter Anne
Margaret O'Leary, now a Squadron Leader (Nursing Officer) in the RAAF became a
Pilot Officer at the end of 1991 and she commenced duties at the Edinburgh RAAF
Base in January 1992, fifty years after Fergus' death. (His commission to the
rank of Pilot Officer was given at the commencement of his active service late
1941).  Anne has since served overseas in East Timor, West Irian and briefly in
the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the time of writing this, and
as I transcribe Fergus' letters from World War II, Australians are again and
still divided about the potential involvement of our troops in yet another war,
in the Middle East again, this time in Iraq.  In a letter written by Fergus
early in December 1941 he makes a pertinent comment about the division then,
amongst his fellow Australians, and the unwillingness of certain parties to
fight in what they saw as someone else's war.  He had just heard the news of
the attack on Pearl Harbour, December 7<sup>th</sup> 1941, and the bombing of Singapore
and Hong Kong at the same time. Would the boys be ready now to defend their
homeland?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It gives one an odd feeling to
read these letters now, reliving the history which took place more than sixty
years ago.  They reveal in some small and personal way the hopes and fears, the
laughter and tears, of our brave young people in the merciless arena of war,
&quot;On Active Service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Fergus' final letter, dated 16<sup>th</sup> January 1942, was written only a week before his death, and one day after
the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese.    He had not known.</p>
